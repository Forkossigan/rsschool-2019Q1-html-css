					<p><span>-Question 1: Introduction to Electron</span><br>
						1.1 Short description<br>
					</p>
					<div>Electron is an open source library developed by GitHub for building cross-platform desktop
						applications with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Electron accomplishes this by combining Chromium
						and Node.js into a single runtime and apps can be packaged for Mac, Windows, and Linux.

						1.2 History of creation<br>
					</p>
					<div>Electron began in 2013 as the framework on which Atom, GitHub's hackable text editor, would be
						built. The two were open sourced in the Spring of 2014.

						It has since become a popular tool used by open source developers, startups, and established
						companies.<br>
						Below are milestones in Electron's history:<br>
						-April 2013: Atom Shell is started <br>
						-May 2014: Atom Shell is open sourced<br>
						-April 2015: Atom Shell is re-named Electron<br>
						-May 2016: Electron releases v1.0.0<br>
						-May 2016: Electron apps compatible with Mac App Store <br>
						-August 2016: Windows Store support for Electron apps

					<div>
						<h3>
							Main and Renderer Processes
						</h3>
						In Electron, the process that runs package.json's main script is called the main process.
						The script that runs in the main process can display a GUI by creating web pages. An Electron
						app always has one main process, but never more.

						Since Electron uses Chromium for displaying web pages, Chromium's multi-process architecture is
						also used. Each web page in Electron runs in its own process, which is called the renderer
						process.

						In normal browsers, web pages usually run in a sandboxed environment and are not allowed access
						to native resources. Electron users, however, have the power to use Node.js APIs in web pages
						allowing lower level operating system interactions.

					<p><span>-Question 2: Main information</span></p>
					<div>
						<h3>
							Differences Between Main Process and Renderer Process

						</h3>
						The main process creates web pages by creating BrowserWindow instances. Each BrowserWindow
						instance runs the web page in its own renderer process. When a BrowserWindow instance is
						destroyed, the corresponding renderer process is also terminated.

						The main process manages all web pages and their corresponding renderer processes. Each renderer
						process is isolated and only cares about the web page running in it.

						In web pages, calling native GUI related APIs is not allowed because managing native GUI
						resources in web pages is very dangerous and it is easy to leak resources. If you want to
						perform GUI operations in a web page, the renderer process of the web page must communicate with
						the main process to request that the main process perform those operations.
